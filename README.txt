To open the game go to wizardo/bin/Release/net5.0-windows/wizardo.exe
(For the project to work you need to download only the wizardo/bin/Release/net5.0-windows folder)

How the game works:
- using arrows/WASD you can rotate your character and move
- you can cast a spell using keys 1, 2 and 3 (but you have to unlock spells first)
- you cast a spell in a direction your character faces
- you have to have sufficient amount of mana to cast a spell, if you don't, the spell fails
- your mana and health regenerate slowly
- you can always rotate your character, but you can move only one tile in a turn and cast one spell
- baware of zombies, they will do their best to bite you, if your health falls to 0, you loose the game
- the objective of each level is to kill all the zombies on the board
- after each level you can select one new spell or an increase in passive regeneration of health or mana

Have fun! :)
